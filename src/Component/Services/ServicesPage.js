                            <p className="text-md mb-4"> The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a single and destination based tax levied on goods & services consumed in an economy. GST as envisaged by the Central Government is a single uniform indirect tax which will treat India as one nation one market.</p>

Not being compliant, can be a heavy cost for a business. The legislation also imposes higher corrective implications in case of errors resulting in short payment of taxes or incorrect availment of credit.

                               <p className="text-md mb-4"> The GST compliance rating is a score given by the government to a business so that other businesses can see how compliant they are with the tax department.
