                            <p className="text-md mb-4"><b>TDS or Tax Deducted at Source</b>, is the amount of tax deducted from money paid at the time of making specified payments such as rent, commission, professional fees, salary, interest and so on.</p>
                            <p className="text-md mb-4">TDS is deducted when a salary or life insurance policy is paid. The TDS sum is then submitted with the Income Tax department. TDS is a method of automatically paying a portion of the tax to the Income Tax department. As a result, TDS is regarded as a method of reducing tax avoidance.</p>
                            <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Example of TDS</h1>

                            <p className="text-md mb-4">XYZ Pvt Ltd makes a payment for office rent of Rs 80,000 per month to the owner of the property. TDS is required to be deducted at 10%. XYZ Pvt Ltd must deduct TDS of Rs 8000 and pay the balance of Rs 72,000 to the owner of the property. Thus, the recipient of income, i.e., the owner of the property in the above case, receives the net amount of Rs 72,000 after deduction of tax at the source. He will add the gross amount, i.e., Rs 80,000, to his income and can take credit for the amount already deducted, i.e., Rs 8,000, by XYZ Pvt Ltd against his final tax liability.</p>
